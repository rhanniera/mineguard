2. Click "Home" or authentication area
3. Enter email: `admin@admin.com`
4. Enter password: `Totheremix123!`
5. Click "Login"

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
1. User submits hazard report
   ↓
2. Report stored in localStorage['reports']
   ↓
3. Admin logs in with credentials
   ↓
4. Admin Dashboard loads all reports
   ↓
5. Admin can:
   - View details
   - Add comments
   - Update status
   - Delete if needed
   - Export data
   ↓
6. All changes immediately saved to localStorage
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- LocalStorage: Supports ~5-10MB per origin
- No server needed (client-side only)
- Real-time updates
- Export files downloadable directly
- Suitable for: Teams of 5-50 users

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation (Frontend):
- Base64 password encoding (NOT secure for production)
- Client-side authentication only
- All data in browser storage

### For Production:
- Use backend authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Hash passwords with bcrypt/scrypt
- Server-side authorization
- HTTPS encryption
- Database (SQL/NoSQL)
- Access logging
- Regular security audits

## 📋 Admin Responsibilities

1. **Daily:**
   - Review critical/high hazard reports
   - Update report statuses
   - Add investigation comments

2. **Weekly:**
   - Export and backup all data
   - Analyze trends and patterns
   - Generate safety reports

3. **Monthly:**
   - Performance metrics review
   - Compliance verification
   - User access audit

## 🛠️ Maintenance Tasks

- Weekly backup via export
- Monthly data cleanup (delete resolved old reports)
- Quarterly performance review
- Annual security audit
